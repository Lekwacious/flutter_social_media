A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a test application for devrecruit Flutter mobile developer recruitment. The project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and firebase storage for saving uploaded files. The project also uses cloud firestore as a NOSQL database to persist data. The project also uses [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) for image handling.
The project uses [Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management, navigation and dependency injection etc. It uses the reactive streams called Obx to listen to events.
To run the project, you need install [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) to your personal computer. You can use any development environment of your choice preferably Android studio.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
